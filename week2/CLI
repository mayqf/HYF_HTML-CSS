1.Research how to create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command.

  echo "create a hidden file or folder"
  mkdir .my_hidden_folder 
  touch .my_hidden_file
  
  echo "display hidden files or folders"
  ls -a
  
2. Research how to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command.
E.g. How would you create 'fun' directory along with all directories in the path below:
/c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun
  
  echo "create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command"
  mkdir -p these/folders/are/just/for/fun
  
3. Execute following commands terminal:

  echo "test" > fun             # open fun files writes in "test" in it
  echo "another test" >> fun    #add "another test" in fun
  wc -c fun                     # 18 fun
  
4. Research how to append something in the file *WITHOUT* a newline character.
E.g.
 echo "test" > fun
 echo "another test" >> fun
 cat fun
 
 Output of "cat fun" is:
 test
 another test
 
How would you use echo command, so that output would be:
testanother test

echo -n "test" > newfun
echo -n "another test" >> newfun
